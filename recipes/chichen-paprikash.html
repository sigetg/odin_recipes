    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        One of my all time favorite dishes, Chicken Paprikash is a heavy, creamy, rich hungarian chicken dish. I used to cook it all the time with my grandmother as I am 1/4 hungarian. Serve it over spatzle or another similar starch for best results!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons pork lard , or butter (lard is traditionally used and we strongly recommend it for the best flavor)</li>
        <li>3 pounds chicken pieces, bone-in and skin-on (this is traditional and recommended because it creates the most flavor, but alternatively you can use boneless/skinless pieces of chicken)</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, very finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>2 Roma tomatoes, seeds removed and very finely diced</li>
        <li>1 Hungarian bell pepper, diced (optional)</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons quality, genuine imported sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>2 cups Aneto 100% All-Natural Chicken Broth (our most favorite chicken broth)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup full fat sour cream , room temperature (important to avoid lumps; be sure also to use full fat)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>  
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the lard in a heavy pot and brown the chicken on all sides.  Transfer the chicken to a plate.  In the same oil, add the onions and fry until golden brown.  Add the garlic and tomatoes (and pepper if using) and fry another 2-3 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the paprika, salt and pepper (paprika becomes bitter if scorched).</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the pot and place it back over the heat.  Pour in the chicken broth. The chicken should be mostly covered. Bring it to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 40 minutes. Remove the chicken and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir the flour into the sour cream/cream mixture to form a smooth paste. Stir the cream mixture into the sauce, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Bring it to a simmer for a couple of minutes until the sauce is thickened. Add salt and pepper to taste. Return the chicken to the sauce and simmer to heat through.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken paprikash with Hungarian nokedli, which is like German Spaetzle only they're very short and stubby.  You can make nokedli with a sp√§tzle scraper and using this recipe for the dough.</li>
