    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>  
        One of my most popular recipes on the blog is my Instant Pot Tuscan Chicken, a recipe with so many 5-star ratings. Everyone loves chicken cooked in a cream sauce, and when it’s combined with garlic, parmesan cheese, and sundried tomatoes, honestly there’s no better combination.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has one of the most delicous cream sauces, and the best part is that you can customize it by using any types of cheeses that you would like.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (50 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream (double cream in the UK)</li>
        <li>½ cup (43 grams) parmesan cheese grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili flakes</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sundried tomatoes chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil and melt the butter on medium heat. Swirl pan to coat with oil and butter evenly.</li>
        <li>Brown the chicken (do not overcrowd and work in batches if needed) for 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer onto a plate, cover, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Saute the garlic for a minute or until it's fragrant. Add the chicken stock, and deglaze the pan scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Adjust the heat to medium-low, and add the heavy cream and the parmesan cheese to the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes, then season with chili flakes, thyme, and oregano.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to your taste, add the sundried tomatoes then put the chicken back in the sauce and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes.</li>
